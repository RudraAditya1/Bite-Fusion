        <p class="des">Litti Chokha is a traditional dish from the state of Bihar in India, known for its rustic flavors and wholesome ingredients. Litti is made from whole wheat flour, mixed with spices, and kneaded into a dough. This dough is then shaped into small balls, filled with a mixture of roasted gram flour, spices like ajwain (carom seeds), and sometimes stuffed with ghee (clarified butter). These filled balls are roasted over a charcoal flame until they are crispy and golden brown. <br> <br> Chokha, the accompanying side dish, is made by roasting eggplants, tomatoes, and potatoes over an open flame until they are charred and soft. The roasted vegetables are then mashed and mixed with chopped onions, green chilies, garlic, mustard oil, and spices like turmeric and salt. This mixture is traditionally prepared using a mortar and pestle, which adds to its unique texture and taste. <br><br>In addition to being delicious, Litti Chokha is also a nutritious meal, packed with proteins, carbohydrates, and essential vitamins. The use of whole wheat flour, gram flour, and a variety of vegetables makes it a wholesome and balanced dish Litti Chokha is not just a dish but a cultural symbol of Bihar, reflecting the state's agricultural roots and simple lifestyle. It is often enjoyed during festivals, weddings, and other celebrations, bringing people together over a shared love for traditional cuisine.</p>
