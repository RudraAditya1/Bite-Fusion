        <p class="des">Sattu is a flour made from roasted gram (chana dal) and is a popular ingredient in Bihari cuisine. It is known for its nutritional value and is often used to make a variety of dishes and drinks. Sattu is rich in protein, fiber, and essential nutrients, making it a healthy addition to the diet.

            One popular way to consume sattu is by mixing it with water and a few spices to make a refreshing and nutritious drink known as "sattu sherbet" or "sattu ka ghol." This drink is especially popular during the hot summer months as it is believed to have cooling properties.
            
            Sattu is also used to make dishes like litti chokha, where sattu flour is mixed with spices and water to form a dough, which is then stuffed into wheat flour balls (litti) and roasted over charcoal or cow dung cakes. The roasted litti is then served with chokha, a spicy mashed vegetable dish.
            
            Overall, sattu is a versatile ingredient that is not only delicious but also provides a range of health benefits, making it a staple in Bihari cuisine.
